# A-Simple_Machine_Translation (MT)
thise code implement a simple machine translation. It used different features:
- **GRU**
- **Embeding**
- **Encoder-Decoder**

it seaved the trained the model, so you do not need to train that again for testing. you could tun the "test.py". It loads the pretrained model and take your English sentence and translate that to French.
It is a simple machine translation for leaning the basics of MT. and the size of dataset is small. 

The accuraccy is low and it miss translate some sentence, but it is a good practice for learning the basics.
